A mid level react project aimed at utilizing reducer and custom api hooks to create a working quiz application. Originally a follow along
project as part of the Ultimate react course I decided to expand upon it utilizing everything I had learnt to make a functioning quiz app

## APP Features

This app utilizes several features and libraries that help it run:

- Core react fundamental concepts
- API calling - the api we are using is from the [OpenTriviaDB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

- The powerful reducer hook

- Custom hooks for api calls

- React Select library for our selection bars

## Languages used

- JavaScript

- CSS3

- HTML5

- React

## Installation Guide

First clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShaAnder/reactQuiz.git
```

NPM install to get the dependancies

```sh
npm install
```

Use npm start to start the local server / test the app

```sh
npm start
```

## Summary

This app was my first major deviation from a course project, I had already learnt all the concepts the follow along had taught and wanted to try to make a working application. Utilizing the trivia API and researching ways to incorporate React select i found that I could build a working app rather easily

We have covered a lot of topic such as:

- Reducer API
- State and multiple state management
- More Custom Hooks
- React Select
- Customizing Custom Components
- Researching
- App Creation Methodologies
- API Based Applications

and more
